I checked for duplicates in the data and it returned the same number of rows and columns which means there were no duplicates.

**DROP NaN VALUES**

I dropped the null values because when i went through and explored the data i realized i couldn't work with the rows with null values so i dropped all of it.

**SPLIT PROPERTY AND OWNER ADDRESS**

For property address, the street and city were in the same column, but then to make the data more readable for users or clients, i split them into different columns, i also did same for owner address.

**PUT PRICE IN DOLLARS**

I manipulated the data and placed a dollar sign in the numbers necessary to let anyone reading the data to understand that the prices were in dollars.

**CONVERT DATA TYPES**

Colums like YearBuilt, Bedrooms, Fullbath and Halfbath were in float format which wasnt supposed to be so so i manipulated it by converting those collumns to integers.

**EXPORT DATA(CLEAN DATA)**
